/*
# File Name: Partial File for Colors
## Description: Defining Colors to be used. Some basic writing & naming conventions to be followed.

### Writing Hex Codes & Naming Variables:
  All hex codes must be in lowercase.
  Use shorter three character hex codes where possible.
  For example, #eeccbb can be written as #ecb.
  Use lowercase, hyphenated names for variables. No underscores allowed.
  Follow alphabetical order as much as possible.

### Primary & Secondary Colors:
  Naming Convention to be used: $primary-PURPOSE & $secondary-PURPOSE.
  For example, $primary-web and $primary-owners-dashboard.

### Black White and everything in between:
  $black and $white should be self explanatory. (Do we need to define them as a variable??)
  The gradient between them can be defined as  $grey-100, $grey-200 ... $grey900.

### Other general colors:
  Other colors that we may need are a secondary color, a particular shade of blue, green, red and yellow/orange.
  Naming them can be based on their purpose.
  $danger, $info, $success & $warning
